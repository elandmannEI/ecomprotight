Magento Ecompro Tight Admin Theme

Maintainer: Eric Landmann, eric@ecompro.tech

Created: 10/1/21

Description

This is an alternate admin theme for Magento 2. It has been tested on Community Edition v. 2.3.5-p1. It requires a fully functional Magento 2 installation.

Features

Alternate color scheme – Tired of the same old stock Magento admin theme and colors? This theme uses a green navbar, orange links, light green footer.

Color variables – There is a color reference found in docs/tight_color_names.html that shows the color variable names and their hex values.

Tighter spacing – There is a lot of wasted page space in the stock Magento admin theme that forces the user to do unnecessary scrolling. The Tight theme tightens up some of that spacing. 

Admin nav – The spacing on the admin nav columns have been tightened up so sites with many columns in the subnav will be more easily able to see them with scrolling sideways.
